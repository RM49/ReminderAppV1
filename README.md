# ReminderAppV1
First attempt at reminder app, first time using android studio and kotlin. 
Just the main code and xml file included  
Tried using sharedPreferences to save data but that was a hassle  
Learned roughly how to use AlarmManager  
Learned basics of using AndroidStudio  
Going to restart using SQL database instead
